# automated-ucheck
 Automates the COVID-19 UCheck system at the University of Toronto.
 
# Instructions:
- Ensure that you have Python 3.9 or greater installed.
- This project requires two dependencies, Selenium, and webdriver-manager.
- To install these libraries, type in your command prompt ```pip install selenium``` and ```pip install webdriver-manager``` for each library respectively.
- Finally, run application.py and enjoy!

# Notes:
This project was not intended to circumvent the COVID precautions at U of T, but rather point them out as useless and redundant, and to show how easy they are to circumvent. This is simply a proof of concept, and I do not advise using this program to circumvent UCheck. This project has been published for educational purposes on how to automate things, and hopefully U of T improves their COVID precautions.
